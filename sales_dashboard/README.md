## Data Modelling

## Analysis
2023 outperformed 2022 in all key metrics (sales, profit, and quantity).

Profitability is not evenly distributed — some high-revenue subcategories underperform in terms of profit.

The final quarter shows a noticeable upward trend, suggesting effective seasonal strategies or increased demand.
